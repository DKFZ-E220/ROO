# Radiation Oncology Ontology

This ontology repository contains three aspects:
* The ontology itself (in the "owl" folder)
* d2r scripts to convert databases into RDF (in the "d2r_scripts" folder)
* Shape Expressions to check if a certain endpoint contains the proper graph structure (in the "shape_expressions" folder)
