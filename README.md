# Radiation Oncology Ontology

This ontology repository contains three aspects:
* The ontology itself (in the "owl" folder)
* d2r scripts to convert databases into RDF (in the "d2r_scripts" folder)
* Shape Expressions to check if a certain endpoint contains the proper graph structure (in the "shape_expressions" folder)

## How to contribute?
Contribution can be done by forking and sending a pull request. Please see [the GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) on contributing using forks and pull requests.
Requests will be handled as soon as possible but formal version updates to the ROO (on bioportal) will happen about every 6 months starting in the end of 2022.
